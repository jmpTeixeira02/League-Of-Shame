# **League Of Shame**

League Of Shame is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot that fetches your [League of Legends](https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/) game and makes a joke about it on a chat server.

The bot was built with [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) and [riotwatcher api](https://riot-watcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

In order to store all the users (and futurely the phrases), it was used [Postgres SQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
